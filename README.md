Background and Scenario Overview
Our consultancy focuses on advancing sustainable, low-carbon building designs to reduce energy usage and environmental impact, particularly through minimizing heating and cooling demands (European Commission, 2003). Increasing energy efficiency in buildings not only helps conserve resources but also aligns with regulatory standards like the European Commission's Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings, which mandates sustainable design practices for environmental compliance (European Commission, 2003).
Statistical analysis is integral to this mission, as it enables the identification of complex relationships between architectural features such as glazing area, compactness, and orientation and the heating and cooling loads of buildings (Tsanasa & Xifara, 2012). Using techniques like regression modelling and correlation analysis, we can quantify these relationships and pinpoint variables that heavily influence energy demands (Tsanasa & Xifara, 2012). This approach equips our consultancy with actionable insights to recommend data-driven, energy-efficient design choices to architects, thus advancing sustainable building practices (European Commission, 2003).
